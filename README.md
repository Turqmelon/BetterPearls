# BetterPearls
Ender Pearls are rideable! How fun!

## How does it work?
When a player throws an ender pearl, they'll be sat on top of it! They'll ride it to their destination.

## Can they dismount early?
Yes... but I wouldn't want to. You're guarenteed to take a lot of fall damage by doing that.

## Can players save themselves from fall damage or "fly" with this?
No. This plugin also requires players to be on the ground to throw a pearl. No endless chains unless they land first.

## What about protected land?
Plugins that would normally cancel the teleport event are respected... sort of. If the teleport event would have been cancelled when they land, they'll be teleported back to the location they threw the pearl from. It doesn't stop dismounting the pearl early though. I can't cancel that.

If you have something that's private enough, I'd prevent entry into the area.
